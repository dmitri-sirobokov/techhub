This application was built in a few hours during one of our Google Days where we get to try out different technologies and hack concepts together. It was built using ML5.js to bring Machine Learning (ML) to the browser through an abstracted layer. This results in this demo fully running on the client with ease of use for the developer due to the abstraction layer. Next to that, it uses the library P5.js to make it a breeze to build a game around it.

This demo makes use of P5.js and ML5.js which go hand in hand and makes building interactive concepts with ML and gamification very approachable for developers.
