This application was built in a few hours during one of our Google Days where we get to try out different technologies and hack concepts together. TensorFlow.js brings Machine Learning (ML) to the browser. This results in this demo fully running on the client of the user without the need for a server to execute the TensorFlow logic.

This demo uses WebGL as the “back-end” for TensorFlow. A trained ML model on the human body and pose is then passed to retrieve the data points from. After that, you can both visualise and build concepts around this data.
